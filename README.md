# üì± Root Finder App

**Year Developed**: 2022  
**Course**: Numerical Methods  
**Built With**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev)  

---

## ‚ú® Overview

This project was created as an assignment for the **Numerical Methods** course, combining theoretical knowledge of root-finding methods with hands-on development using **Flutter**. As my first real Flutter application, it served as both a learning experience and a practical tool for solving numerical equations.

The app provides a simple, text-based interface to compute results for various root-finding methods. It is open to students, educators, or anyone interested in numerical methods.

## üßÆ Features

- Implements the following root-finding methods:
  - **Newton-Raphson**
  - **Secant Method**
  - **Bisection Method**
  - **False Position Method**
  - **Fixed Point Iteration**
- Clean and minimalistic design.
- Provides step-by-step, text-based results.
- Lightweight APK available for quick deployment.
